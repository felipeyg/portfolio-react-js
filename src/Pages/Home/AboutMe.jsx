          <p className="hero--section-description">Hey, how's it going? I'm Felipe, 27 years old, born in Bauru-SP. I'm in the final year of Production Engineering at EEL-USP. In college, I played basketball, American football, and took a chance on volleyball in beach volleyball. I was a substitute in basketball but the starting quarterback in American football =)</p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">I also participated in a student organization focused on entrepreneurship, where I had the opportunity to serve as the president for one year.</p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">However, I don't see myself working as a production engineer. I'm going to pursue my dream of becoming a programmer, and for that, I'm dedicating myself 1000%. I hope to receive a job opportunity soon because I know I won't disappoint.</p>
